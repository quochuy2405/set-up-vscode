	// Place your snippets for scss here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "mixin-responsive",
		"body": [
			"/* Responsive */\n@mixin sm {\n@media (max-width: 640px) {\n@content;\n}\n}\n@mixin md {\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n@content;\n}\n}\n@mixin lg {\n@media (max-width: 1024px) {\n@content;\n}\n}\n@mixin xl {\n@media (max-width: 1280px) {\n@content;\n}\n}\n",
			"$2"
